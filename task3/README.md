# Social Distancing detector
Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases. It implies that people physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of a contagious disease (such as the COVID-19 Disease).

## Features:
* Apply object detection to detect only people in a video stream.
* Compute the pairwise distances between all detected people
* Based on the computed distances, we determine whether social distancing rule is being violated or not.

## Install dependencies

```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this project. you used yolo_v3 to detect the social distancing. In order to run this code you should download yolov3 weights from the link given below:
